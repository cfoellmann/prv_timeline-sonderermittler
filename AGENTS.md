# AGENTS.md

Repository guide for coding agents working in `prv_timeline-sonderermittler`.

This file is derived from [`vault/Sonderermittler der Krone/CLAUDE.md`](vault/Sonderermittler%20der%20Krone/CLAUDE.md) and adapted for general agent use at repo scope.

## Purpose

This repository combines:

- an Obsidian-style Markdown wiki for the audio drama universe around **"Sonderermittler der Krone"**
- a small web app in [`app/`](app/) that renders the series and episodes as an interactive timeline

Christian curates the content. Agents maintain structure, consistency, cross-links, and app data.

## Core Rules

- Treat `vault/Sonderermittler der Krone/raw/` as immutable source material. Do not edit files there unless the task is explicitly to ingest a new source.
- Treat `vault/Sonderermittler der Krone/wiki/` as agent-maintained content.
- Keep `vault/Sonderermittler der Krone/index.md` and `vault/Sonderermittler der Krone/log.md` in sync with meaningful wiki updates.
- If you change episode-level wiki content, also update [`app/data/folgen.json`](app/data/folgen.json).
- Record larger structural repo changes in [`changelog.md`](changelog.md).
- Do not introduce new schema or naming conventions silently. If the existing convention does not fit, stop and ask.
- Do not do web research unless the user explicitly asks for it. Default to the material already stored in `raw/`.
- Do not present speculation as fact. Mark uncertain statements clearly as assumptions or open questions.

## Domain Summary

Maritim started the universe with *Oscar Wilde & Mycroft Holmes*. The repository tracks the wider connected audio drama universe, including spin-offs, crossovers, and the **Zirkel der Sieben** as a central connective concept.

The main goal is to preserve:

- which episode belongs to which series
- listening order vs. release order
- key figures and concepts
- the best-known in-universe chronology

## File and Naming Conventions

### Paths

- Series pages: `vault/Sonderermittler der Krone/wiki/serien/<serie-slug>.md`
- Episode pages: `vault/Sonderermittler der Krone/wiki/folgen/<serie-slug>-<nr-2-stellig>-<titel-slug>.md`
- Character pages: `vault/Sonderermittler der Krone/wiki/figuren/<vorname-nachname>.md`
- Concept pages: `vault/Sonderermittler der Krone/wiki/konzepte/<konzept-slug>.md`

### Slugs

- Lowercase only
- Use hyphens as separators
- Replace umlauts: `ä -> ae`, `ö -> oe`, `ü -> ue`, `ß -> ss`
- Remove special characters

### Links

- Inside the vault, prefer Obsidian wikilinks like `[[wiki/figuren/oscar-wilde|Oscar Wilde]]`.
- For ambiguous names, disambiguate explicitly.

## Required Frontmatter

Series, episode, character, and concept pages should use YAML frontmatter.

Minimum canonical shape:

```yaml
---
type: folge | serie | figur | konzept
serie: <serie-slug>          # only for episodes
nummer: <int>                # only for episodes
titel: <Original-Titel>
erschienen: JJJJ-MM-TT       # if known
verlag: Maritim
autor: <Autor:in>            # for episode/series when known
sprecher:
  - rolle: <Rolle>
    name: <Sprecher:in>
zirkel: true | false
crossover_mit:
  - <serie-slug>
status: stub | entwurf | recherchiert | review | final
quellen:
  - <pfad-oder-url>
tags:
  - <freie tags>
---
```

`status` matters. Preserve it carefully and update it when a page meaningfully matures.

## Content Policy

### Language

- Write wiki content in German.
- Keep proper names in their original form where appropriate.

### Spoilers

Default spoiler level is **grob**.

Episode pages should normally include:

- metadata
- key figures
- Zirkel relevance
- a short setup / hook / arc summary in 3 to 6 sentences

Do **not** include by default:

- the resolution
- culprit identities
- major twists
- deaths of important characters
- betrayal reveals

Full-spoiler summaries should only be added when explicitly requested and should be clearly marked.

### Canon vs. Theory

- Separate sourced canon from fan theories.
- Use sections such as `## Theorien & offene Fragen` when needed.

### Re-releases

- Re-release lines such as archive releases are not standalone top-level series by default.
- Document them as subsections under the main series page, including a table of deviations where known.

## Standard Workflows

### 1. Ingest a New Source

When a user provides a new source:

1. Place or confirm the source in the correct `raw/` folder.
2. Read it and summarize the relevant facts.
3. Update or create affected wiki pages.
4. If an episode is involved, update [`app/data/folgen.json`](app/data/folgen.json).
5. Update `vault/Sonderermittler der Krone/index.md`.
6. Append a dated entry to `vault/Sonderermittler der Krone/log.md`.
7. If the repo structure or schema changed, also update `changelog.md`.

### 2. Answer a Content Question

When the user asks a wiki/domain question:

1. Read `index.md` and the relevant wiki pages.
2. Answer using the current repo content.
3. If the result would be useful as durable documentation, consider storing it as a new page in `wiki/` and then update `index.md` and `log.md`.

### 3. Lint / Health Check

On request, inspect for:

- stale `stub` pages
- contradictions between pages
- orphaned pages without inbound links
- missing target pages for repeated wikilinks
- outdated status markers
- series without episode lists
- episodes without character coverage

Store the report as `vault/Sonderermittler der Krone/wiki/queries/lint-JJJJ-MM-TT.md` if you create one.

## Timeline App Requirements

The web app treats [`app/data/folgen.json`](app/data/folgen.json) as a single source of truth for rendering.

Whenever an episode page is created or materially changed, keep the matching `folgen[]` entry aligned:

- create the entry if it does not exist
- keep `id` aligned with the markdown slug
- update `serie`, `nummer`, `titel`, `erschienen`
- update `story_jahr`, `story_monat`, `story_tag`, `story_praezision`, and `story_anmerkung` when chronology becomes clearer
- update `zirkel` from `unklar` to `direkt`, `indirekt`, or `kein` when justified
- keep `spoiler_level` aligned with the wiki page
- keep `wiki` as a repo-relative URL-encoded path

If a new series is added, also add or update the relevant `serien[]` entry.

Important consistency rules:

- `id` is the key and must match the markdown slug
- `story_praezision: "unbekannt"` is valid and preferred over `null`
- `zirkel: "unklar"` is the default unknown state
- schema changes require a `schema_version` bump and a `changelog.md` entry

## Session Start Checklist

For substantial wiki work, begin by checking:

1. `vault/Sonderermittler der Krone/log.md`
2. `vault/Sonderermittler der Krone/index.md`
3. the directly relevant wiki and app data files

If there has been a long gap in activity, offering a lint pass is reasonable.

## Practical Editing Guidance

- Keep changes cohesive. If one fact affects multiple pages, update them together.
- Prefer small, consistent updates over speculative completeness.
- Preserve existing manual curation choices unless the task is clearly to replace them.
- When editing generated wiki pages, keep source sections current.
- When working only on app code, still preserve the domain assumptions encoded in `folgen.json`.
